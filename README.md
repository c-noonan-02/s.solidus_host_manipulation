This repository forms part of my Grant Proposal Assessment for the course
"Ecology and Evolution of Infectious Disease", as part of my second semester
teaching for my MSc in Ecology, Evolution and Biodiversity. 

The project aim is to design an experiment that can fill a research gap for a
specific case study example of proposed host-manipulation by parasites. I was
assigned the case study of behavioural manipulation of sticklebacks by the
S. solidus tapeworm, in order to increase transmission to tertiary hosts. 

The data within this repository is dummy data, randomly generated to show
specific relationships (under different hypotheses) that I might expect should I
conduct the experiment I have proposed.
